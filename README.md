# Final-project

Change your username and email in the cmd in the VM so we know who did the commits.

Just do the two commands below and change my netid to yours. 

Username:
git config --global user.name "awt46"

Email:
git config --global user.email "awt46@cornell.edu"

How to play:

Command the blue units to eliminate all red units. 

Use arrow keys to move the cursor. Use Z to select a character or options. 

Blue tiles are tiles characters can move to, and red tile are tiles that characters can attack. 

Use X to cancel selections. Use A to quickly move the cursor to a unit that is ready.
